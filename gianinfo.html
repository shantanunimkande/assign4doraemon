<P><h3><i><u>
    He is recognized by his large build (might partly be contributed by obesity) as well as his mean and aggressive behavior. He "rules" the neighborhood with force, often at the physical expense of other children, especially Nobita, who often resorts to asking Doraemon for gadgets to get even on him. He appears to be just as dependent on Nobita as Nobita is on Doraemon as he constantly tells him what to do despite Nobita's protests. In addition, he has a tendency to steal or rob others, usually Suneo, who offers to be Gian's sidekick on most occasions.
